# Reservations Database Schema

## Table: reservations
- id (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT)
- name (TEXT NOT NULL)
- email (TEXT NOT NULL)
- phone (TEXT NOT NULL)
- date (TEXT NOT NULL)

- guests (TEXT NOT NULL)
- special_request (TEXT)

## Description:
This database stores customer reservation information for the coffee shop. The current implementation uses localStorage in the browser to simulate the database functionality. In a production environment, this would be replaced with a proper backend database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).

## Fields:
- id: Unique identifier for each reservation
- name: Customer's full name
- email: Customer's email address
- phone: Customer's phone number
- date: Reservation date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- time: Reservation time (HH:MM format)
- guests: Number of guests (value from dropdown options)
- special_request: Any special requests from the customer
- timestamp: When the reservation was created (ISO format)
